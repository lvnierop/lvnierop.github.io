  <h3>About</h3>

  I’m a machine learning scientist working with a physics mindset: invariance, equivariance, representation learning, and world-model style approaches.

  My background in theoretical physics shapes how I think about modern models, especially the role of symmetry and geometry in attention and representation learning.

  I’m particularly interested in gauge-like symmetries in Transformers, structural parameter reductions, and systems that actually train at scale.

- **Interests:** gauge/equivariance analogies in Transformers, geometric viewpoints on attention, and practical systems that actually train.
- **Current:** industry ML (signals / representation learning), developing experiments toward publishable notes.
- **Writing:** [Notes](/notes/)
